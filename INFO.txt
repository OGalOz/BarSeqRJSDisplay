Program Info:

To run, consider sample_start.sh


So far there are 3 important data objects:

    1. We get a mapping from column number to set name

    2. We get a mapping from row number to gene info

    3. We get the 'volcano_object', which has 6 keys:
        min_x: minimum fitness score out of all
        min_y: minimum t-score (absolute values -> this will be 0)
        max_x: maximum fitness score out of all
        max_y: maximum t-score
        fit_mega_matrix: list<list<fitness (Num), fitness(Num),...>>
        t_mega_matrix: list<list<t_score (Num), t_score (Num),...>>

    Where the two 'mega matrices' contain all of the values for the conditions
        (columns) vs genes (rows).


NOTE: WE SPLIT GENE INFORMATION BY this character: '|', so it is
        crucial that this character is not included in gene info
